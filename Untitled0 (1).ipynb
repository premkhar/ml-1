        "   In Python, a parameter is a variable defined within the parentheses of a function definition. It acts as a placeholder for a value that will be passed to the function when it is called. Parameters allow functions to accept input and perform operations based on that input. When a function is called, the values passed to it are called arguments, which are then assigned to the corresponding parameters within the function's scope.\n",
